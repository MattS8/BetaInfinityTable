# BetaInfinityTable
Color code for the Beta infinity table

## Updating the Table's Code
1. First you'll need to download and install Arduino from [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. Then clone or download this project (if you don't know what you're doing, look up how to clone a github project, or just download the zip by clicking on the green *Clone or Download* button)
3. Open the file called ***Main.ino*** (it should automatically open with Arduino if you followed step 1)
4. Click on **Tools** -> **Board: (Something in quotes)** and then make sure *Arduino/Genuino Uno* is selected
5. Edit this code and then click on the *checkmark* button at the top left to verify the code is valid
6. Then plug your computer into the Beta Sign usb cable (it should be hidden inside the sign next to the circuit box with the knob)
5. Click on **Tools** -> **Port: (Something in quotes)** and make sure the right port is selected (probably something like *COM3*)
6. Finally click on the *arrow* button next to the checkmark to upload the code to the Arduino board

***Please upload the latest version of code to this repository***
